# RPA-RobotsLearning
Robots created thanks to Leon Petrou's class in Udemy Academy.

Hi people!
This is just a small advance in my RPA career, hopefully I will upload some other projects very soon.

This Robot consults on the weather of any city you enter and advise you to use certaing clothing. 
We use Input dialogs, use application/browser, click, getText, keyboard shortcuts, type into, flowchart, flow decision, etc...

Once the bot is running, it requests the user to enter the City name, goes to Google, checks the weather, gets the weather and description, and uses it to advise the user to use certain clothing.
